# Near_Earth_Object_Visualization
Project to visualize different characteristics of Near Earth Objects.

This project utilized both Python and R programming langauges to complete.
It was purely a visualization project to practice taking some raw data, preparing it and then running it through Shiny to visualise it with some interactive tools.
Python was used to prepare the data. 
R was used to put together the graphics and Shiny web application. 


As the Shiny code requires RStudio to run, a youtube presentation is available at the following link to get a look at the webpage:

Otherwise, run the ui.R and server.R files in RStudio.
